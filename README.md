# Wikipedia-Nano-Clone
It is just a simple use of wikipedia library of python. Using this library, I created a nano version of wikipedia in python. 
It provides us with brief notes on the topics we search from wikipedia itself. It is a fast and easy to use application.
We can run it as many times we need to without any problems.
